# testing for this was done manually instead of automatically because of the
# nature of the code
# different combination of initial requests were tested
# such as by typing icmpAttack, tcpAttack, portstatus, and ipcheck

# the results were tracked and verified as we went on
# for tasks that involved testing one-to-many jobs, then 2-3 clients were created with 1 server
# with a client acting as a job seeker and a server acting as a job creator
